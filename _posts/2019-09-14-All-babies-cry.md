Today was a tough day. Our baby boy is almost three weeks old, and this was the first time when he was fussy for most of the day. Most of his naps were really short. He was asking for feeds more frequent than so far, taking only an hour or less break between them. In the afternoon, he started crying like the end of the world had just happened, and we couldn't console him at all. He would only stop crying while he was feeding or being close to mum's chest. These were the only options...

I must admit it was a challenge for both of us. Ironically, we were just watching an online course about infancy, that was giving all sorts of tips and tricks on how to soothe a baby. If only our baby boy watched the same video... I mean, those tips are great, except when the hell breaks loose and instead of sweet Hollywood baby cry you hear tormented goat shriek coming out of your own baby, you start questioning every theory you picked up so far... and few decisions you made in life...

Eventually, we decided to call a parenting advice hotline. It was Tresillian (https://www.tresillian.org.au/) in our case. On the other end of the line, a genial person informed us about a concept called PURPLE Crying (link) and offered few techniques do to break our baby's 1-hour feed-fuss cycle, he was going through Following the advice, utterly heartbroken, I kept him crying in my arms for a time long enough for him to settle, and mum to recover from an extended duty this day. Before we did it, we made sure he was well-fed and clean. All I could think of was that I really wanted to comfort him that I'm there for him, so I talked to him gently and sang a little. He'd eventually fallen asleep on my chest, and I was terrified to move him, so we stayed like that for over two hours.

Of course, letting him sleep on my chest was highly not recommended approach by every source we read and heard. Still, we couldn't think of anything different so patiently monitored him while he slept this way.

Back to the story, the advice we got from Tresillian actually worked. Obviously, they haven't advised sleeping on daddy's chest, but soothing a baby long enough to go back to 2 hours feed cycle and letting mum and baby's belly to recover. After making him wait a little bit longer for a feed and feeding for a longer time, we managed to put him on a few more full sleep cycles.

In the end, we got him relaxed, fed and hopefully feeling that we are close to him, we do damage control of broken patterns later...

> Today's lessons:
>
> * The first time your baby goes into unconsolable cry is though, it's heartbreaking, and no theory can prepare for that.
> * Knowing that all babies cry and hearing your own crying that tears your soul into pieces are two different > things.
> * Call for help if you feel like you need one, get all the numbers from your caregiver or GP and use them.
> *Staying calm is crucial. Babies are powerful mirrors of our own moods. Be there for your baby, they will cry and make soul-shattering noises, but all they have is us, and we should do our best and not add to their stress.
