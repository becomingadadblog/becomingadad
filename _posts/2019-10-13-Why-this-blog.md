summary: Why this blog?
---

There is a lot of buzz upon arrival of a baby, especially when it's the first one. Friends send a stream of congratulations and best wishes, our closest ones start to check-in hourly, and maybe you even get a mention at work. They are asking how mum and baby are feeling, offering help and support, and occasionally cracking a joke about sleepless nights starting. You know, the usual stuff.

Because childbirth is rather hard endeavour and both baby and mum would be exhausted and willing to rest (if they don't look like it, it doesn't mean they are not tired, they are just high on hormones so give them time to sleep anyway). As a partner, it's our responsibility to handle public relations, and we'll do most of the talking, social media, photos etc. I started to notify people and managing most of the traffic, letting my partner talk only to few dearest ones. 

This was the time when I got surprised by a few of my friends. They asked how mum and baby are feeling, and gave the account of the story, with the level of details agreed beforehand with my partner, they asked me "and how do YOU feel?". And they were genuinely interested, each of them for different reasons. Some of them because they know me well, and they care about my wellbeing, others wanted to learn about the experience of becoming a dad. So I responded.

I responded to them the best I could on the spot, but, more importantly, I started to write it down. When I mentioned it to one of my friends, he strongly encouraged me to publish them. Initially, I've seen a little value in doing that, but I recalled my early days as an expecting dad. 

During the pregnancy, I realised how little assistance for dads and partners is there. On one occasion, I went to a workshop that covered the whole being a dad thing under 10 minutes... with Q&A. It was deemed progressive... I also found a few books helping dads understand pregnancy and childbirth, but I found their voice either shallow or technical. They were considering dads as a secondary role in the play, and I wanted to immerse myself in this experience.

This is how this blog got conceived. It is a compilation of my insights, lessons learned, and hints I figured out throughout my becoming a dad journey. I write those down with hope you finding them useful. Transition to this role can be really overwhelming, and there are enough bumps on the way to make us stressed, anxious, or lonely.

Becoming a dad is a marvellous and rewarding element of life. There is no substitute to that if you want to experience it. I hope this blog will help you and you find bits and pieces you could use, or maybe (knowing that we all struggle, make mistakes and feel bewildered every now and then) it will make you feel a little bit better.
