## How we process your data

This website is powered by Jekyll and is hosted on GitHub. Github, (like any hosting company) can have full insight in visitor data, like connecting IP addresses, visited pages, etc. Note that Github is not known to actively profile visitors. By using a VPN you can (try to) prevent this.

## Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. This happens only if you approve third party cookies and scripts. We use Google Analytics to better understand what pages are more popular and what is our audience. However, we have taken actions to limit the power of Google. We have configured Google Analytics to anonymize IP addresses and we enforce SSL at all times.

## Use of cookies

This website uses cookies for analytics purposes. Cookies are small text files installed on your browser that helps us understand how our audience use this website. We only install cookies if you give us a consent. You can also control cookies using your internet browser.
